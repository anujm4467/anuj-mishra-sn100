This project serves as a base for the first stage of the interview process at Zaapi.

Take this opportunity to inspect the code, run the project and try to debug and fix the issues you find in this existing project built using Express.
During your interview you will need to answer questions about how you found the bugs, the reason behind the fixes you made, and why you decided some particular working code needed improvement.
